# Hotel Management System - Admin API

## Project Overview

This project is a FastAPI-based backend API for managing hotel rooms, customers, bookings, and document uploads. It uses PostgreSQL as the database and AWS S3 for file storage. The project is well-structured, with a clear separation of concerns between API endpoints, business logic, data models, and services.

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (or pip)
- Docker

### Development

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

2.  **Run Database Migrations:**
    ```bash
    uv run alembic upgrade head
    ```

3.  **Start the Development Server:**
    ```bash
    uv run uvicorn app.main:app --reload
    ```
    The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

### Docker

To run the application using Docker, use the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8050/docs`.

### Testing

Run the test suite with the following command:

```bash
uv run pytest tests/ -v
```
